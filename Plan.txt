Plan:
When emote spam is relevant / being looked for:
Clip the stream and download the clip
Save timestamp for when it was spammed (10 minutes will have to go by for comments)

After 10 minutes:
Go through the comments and get the comments for that video

And render the comments

Stitch the video and comments render together.

Do all of this until the stream ends or when an end command has been sent

When an end command has been sent:
Stitch the remaining videos together
Upload the video to youtube e.g. DD/MM/YYYY - STREAMER_NAME - STREAM_TITLE
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When I have finished implementing this:
Port the code to the raspberry pi and scale the code up so it will work with multiple streamers

OR

I can remake the "read chat bot" thingy and build it back up with scaling in mind
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Also make the bot be more customizable with all the numbers inside of a config file or something
